# Closure Objects
## Playing with closures to behave like objects

In python, go and rust

Also, some examples generated by ChatGTP which usually doesn't work

- closure_pbjects: basic idea, have a function that has a local int variable and returns two closures to increment and get the value of the variable. 
- closure_point: basically the same, with x & y variables and returning a dict/map of closure to manipulate the object. Also a factory function that creates independent point "objects"
