# Closure Objects
## Playing with closures to make them behave like objects

In python, go and rust

Also, some examples generated by ChatGTP which usually doesn't work

- **closure_objects**: basic idea, have a function that has a local int variable and returns two closures to increment and get the value of the variable. 
- **closure_point**: basically the same, with x & y variables and returning a dict/map of closures to manipulate the object.


*BTW* Have no idea what this could be used for
